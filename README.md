Weapon Detection using AI and DL for Security Applications

## Abstract

Security is always a main concern in every domain, due to a rise in crime rate in a crowded event or suspicious lonely areas. Abnormal detection and monitoring have major applications of computer vision to tackle various problems. Due to growing demand in the protection of safety, security and personal properties, needs and deployment of video surveillance systems can recognize and interpret the scene and anomaly events play a vital role in intelligence monitoring. This paper implements automatic gun (or) weapon detection using a convolution neural network (CNN) based SS D and Faster RCNN algorithms. Proposed implementation uses two types of datasets. One dataset, which had pre-labelled images and the other one is a set of images, which were labelled manually. Results are tabulated, both algorithms achieve good accuracy, but their application in real situations can be based on the trade-off between speed and accuracy. 

## Proposed System

Proposed implementation focuses on accurate gun detection and classification. Also concerned with accuracy, since a false alarm could result in adverse responses. Choosing the right approach required to make a proper trade-off between accuracy and speed. Figure 1 shows the methodology of weapons detection using deep learning. Frames are extracted from the input video. Frame differencing algorithm is applied and bounding box created before the detection of object.
